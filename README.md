# Mental Fitness Tracker
Project Overview
The Mental Fitness Tracker is an advanced analytics suite designed to model, analyze, and forecast mental health dynamics at population scale. This project integrates multidimensional health data, leverages modern data engineering best practices, and operationalizes both classical and ensemble machine learning to deliver interpretable, actionable intelligence for the mental health domain.

Developed with scalability and reproducibility in mind, this notebook provides a foundation for both exploratory research and production-grade modeling of mental health risk factors and outcomes.

Key Features
Robust Data Handling

Ingests and harmonizes multiple real-world datasets relating to the prevalence and impact of mental/substance use disorders.

Implements systematic cleaning: missing value management, precise column renaming, data type optimization.

Synthetic and large-scale data capabilities for extended benchmarking.

Intelligent Feature Engineering

Automated transformation of raw indicators (e.g., normalization of prevalence rates).

Modular renaming strategies for enhanced readability and maintainability.

Insightful Visual Analytics

Uses Plotly Express for dynamic, publication-ready visualizations of trends, distributions, and comparative metrics (year-on-year shifts, disorder prevalence, DALYs).

Interactive dashboards suitable for technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Predictive Modeling

End-to-end linear and random forest regression pipelines for institutional prediction of aggregate mental fitness burden.

Thorough model validation with MSE, RMSE, and R² reporting on both train and test cohorts, supporting transparent model analysis and tuning.

User-centric Interactive Prediction

Leverages ipywidgets to deliver an accessible, customizable front-end for domain experts to simulate future scenarios and assess the impact of modifiable risk factors.

Widget-driven prediction loop: immediate feedback, efficient for hypothesis testing and educational demos.

Optional HPC Acceleration

Seamless integration of cudf.pandas for GPU-accelerated dataframe operations—supporting workflows on modern hardware for enterprise-scale data volumes.

Getting Started
Environment Requirements

Python 3.7+

Library stack: numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, scikit-learn, ipywidgets

For GPU/data acceleration (optional): NVIDIA GPU drivers, cuDF

Setup

Clone or download the repository.

Open Mental_Fitness_Tracker_project.ipynb in Google Colab (recommended for seamless widget and cloud support), or in your preferred Jupyter environment.

Upload the required datasets:

prevalence-by-mental-and-substance-use-disorder _AI.csv

mental-and-substance-use-as-share-of-disease -AI.csv

Execute notebook cells in order for full data pipeline, exploration, modeling, and prediction workflows.

Customization

The pipeline is modular—engineers and analysts can extend preprocessing, swap out algorithms, or automate data refresh cycles with minimal rework.

Interactive widgets are pre-configured but easily modified for additional predictors or more granular policy scenarios.
